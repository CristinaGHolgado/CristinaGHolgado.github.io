# 🐦 About

Hola! I'm Cristina (for some Christine or Christina or Gracia Holdago) and I'm  a young research engineer at the University of Poitiers and a PhD student at the University of Corsica, under the supervision of Stella Retali-Medori (University of Corsica) and co-supervision of Marianne Vergez-Couret (University of Poitiers).

My thesis focuses on low-resource languages and linguistic variation in the area of Natural Language Processing. In particular, for Corsican and Poitevin-Saintongeais, two regional languages of France. It is part of the [ANR DIVITAL](https://divital.gitpages.huma-num.fr/en/) project, a projet aiming to provide linguistic resources and support with language technologies to several regional languages of France, including Alsatian and Occitan.

Earlier, I worked at Lattice (Paris), where I focused on syntactic parsing and lexicons for Old French within the [Profiterole](https://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/amp/projets/projets-passes/projets-anr/projet-anr-profiterole/) project. I joined the project during a master internship at the ATILF laboratory (Nancy) under the supervision of Mathieu Constant (University of Lorraine) and Alexey Lavrentiev (ENS Lyon). During that time, my work focused on the challenges of automatic lemmatization for an historical non-standardized language, which is described in the following [article](https://aclanthology.org/2021.jeptalnrecital-taln.14/).

My research interests are primarily focused on low-resource and nonstandard languages, both from historical and contemporary perspectives. I am interested in other areas, such as automatic text simplification (the main subject of my master's thesis), as well as misinformation and political polarization.

## Teachings
Since 2023, I have been teaching in *Sciences du langage* (Linguistics) at the University of Poitiers. My teaching covers core areas of linguistics (lexicology and pragmatics), as well as corpus-based approaches and methodological tools for linguists.
