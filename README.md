Hola! I'm Cristina and I'm currently a Research engineer (**ing√©nieure de recherche**) at the University of Poitiers where I have started a co-supervised thesis with Marianne Verget Couret (University of Poitiers) and Stella Retali-Medori (University of Corsica).

My thesis focuses low-ressourced languages in the area of Natural Language Processing. Specifically, poitevin-saintongeais and corsican. It is part of the [ANR DIVITAL](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE23-0025) project, a projet aiming to provide rich linguistic resources and language technologies to several regional languages of France.

Earlier, I was a research engineer at Lattice lab (Paris), where I focused in syntactic parsing and lexicons whithin the [Profiterole](https://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/amp/projets/projets-passes/projets-anr/projet-anr-profiterole/) project. I joined the project during a master internship at the ATILF laboratory (Nancy) under the supervision of Matthieu Constant (University of Lorraine) and Alexey Lavrentiev (ENS Lyon). During that time, my work focused on the challenges of automatic lemmatization for an historical non-standardized language which is described in the following [article]().

My research interests lie primarly in low-ressource and non-standardized languages, both historical and contemporary. I am also interested in other areas such as automatic text simplification, on which I redirected my master thesis work, and the issue of fake news and political polarization.
